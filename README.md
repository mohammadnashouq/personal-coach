Human pose estimation on the popular MS COCO Dataset can detect 17 different keypoints (classes). Each keypoint is annotated with three numbers (x,y,v), where x and y mark the coordinates, and v indicates if the keypoint is visible. "nose", "left_eye", "right_eye", "left_ear", "right_ear", "left_shoulder", "right_shoulder", "left_elbow", "right_elbow", "left_wrist", "right_wrist", "left_hip", "right_hip", "left_knee", "right_knee", "left_ankle", "right_ankle"

Human Activity Estimation A rather obvious application of pose estimation is tracking and measuring human activity and movement. Architectures like DensePose, PoseNet, or OpenPose are often used for activity, gesture, or gait recognition. Examples of human activity tracking via the use of pose estimation include: Application for detecting sitting gestures, recognizing hand gestures, or analyzing facial expressions AI-based analysis of players and athletes in football, basketball, cricket, etc. Applications to analyze dance techniques (for example, in ballet dances) Computer vision systems to assess the quality of surgeries in medical applications. Fitness applications to detect the execution form of exercises and count repetitions. Full body/sign language communication (for example, traffic policemen signals). Intelligent applications to detect people falling or the process of certain diseases.

# How to get started 
The enterprise computer vision platform Viso Suite makes it possible to build and deliver pose estimation systems rapidly and at scale. The end-to-end solution is used by global leaders to implement real-world pose estimation applications using common CCTV or USB cameras with various AI hardware and the latest processors.

# Final goal
To make the user record himself while playing and the system check if he made a mistake and correct the move. 
The system could rise an worning alarm when a mistake made then suggest the correction.
Analyse the progess of the trainee.
Paid subscription.
I can add feature to hire personal trainer in the app
the client can upload video as well and get the result later.
Make the app count the repetitions
